# 🎯 Executive Summary: Fixing Low Sequence Recovery

**Author**: Expert in Deep Learning & Protein Design (10+ Years at DeepMind)  
**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Problem**: 29.5% sequence recovery (should be 40-60%)  
**Solution**: Architectural fixes (1 hour to implement, 3 hours to retrain)

---

## 📋 THE PROBLEM IN 3 SENTENCES

1. Your VAE predicts **structure** (coordinates) AND **sequence** (amino acids) from shared latents
2. The latents are optimized for structure (8 losses) not sequence (1 loss), so sequence info is lost
3. Sequence is predicted from **geometry** (after EGNN), but geometry doesn't contain chemical information needed for sequence

**Result**: Only 29.5% of amino acids are correctly predicted (random guessing is 5%)

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION IN 3 STEPS

### **Step 1: Add Sequence Bypass Pathway** (15 min)

**What**: Predict sequence DIRECTLY from latents, BEFORE EGNN processes them into geometry

**Why**: Latents still contain chemical features from ESM embeddings. After EGNN, only geometry remains.

**Code change**: 
```python
# In models/en_gnn_decoder.py, add direct sequence prediction:
seq_logits = self.sequence_head_direct(z_g + z_l)  # NEW: before EGNN
# Instead of:
seq_logits = self.sequence_head(h_after_egnn)     # OLD: after EGNN
```

**Expected gain**: +5-8% sequence recovery (→ 35-38%)

---

### **Step 2: Increase Sequence Loss Weight** (1 min)

**What**: Make sequence prediction as important as structure prediction

**Why**: Currently 8 structure losses vs 1 sequence loss → structure dominates

**Code change**:
```python
# In models/vae.py, line 49:
--w_seq 20.0  # OLD
--w_seq 80.0  # NEW (4× increase)
```

**Expected gain**: +2-3% sequence recovery (→ 37-40%)

---

### **Step 3: Add Sequence-Latent Consistency** (30 min)

**What**: Force latent space to cluster same amino acids together

**Why**: Prevents sequence information from being lost during VAE compression

**Code change**:
```python
# In models/losses.py, add contrastive loss:
# Same amino acids should have similar latents
loss_consistency = contrastive_loss(latents, amino_acid_labels)
```

**Expected gain**: +3-5% sequence recovery (→ 40-45%)

## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS

### **Scientific Understanding**

1. **Geometry ≠ Chemistry**
   - Backbone coordinates only contain structural information
   - Amino acid identity requires chemical/evolutionary information
   - Cannot predict sequence from structure alone (many AAs have identical backbones)

2. **Multi-Task VAE Pitfalls**
   - Shared latent space creates competition between tasks
   - Task with more loss terms dominates optimization
   - Need balanced losses OR separate latent spaces

3. **Information Bottleneck**
   - VAE compression discards information
   - Structure reconstruction has strong gradients
   - Sequence information is the first to be lost

### **Architectural Lessons**

1. **Don't process sequence through geometry-focused modules**
   - EGNN is designed for geometric processing
   - It discards chemical features by design (equivariance)
   - Sequence needs separate pathway

2. **Loss weighting is critical**
   - Single loss weight doesn't account for # of terms
   - Need to balance TOTAL gradient magnitude, not individual losses
   - Adaptive weighting or separate latents preferred

3. **Direct pathways preserve information**
   - Skip connections work for a reason
   - Bypass geometric processing for chemical prediction
   - Similar to ResNet skip connections

## 🔬 VALIDATION METRICS

After implementing fixes, measure:

### **Primary Metrics**

1. **Sequence Recovery**: % correctly predicted amino acids
   - Current: 29.5%
   - Target: 40-45% (Tier 1), 50-55% (Tier 2), 60%+ (Tier 3)

2. **Structure Quality**: Reconstruction RMSD
   - Current: 0.546Å
   - Target: <0.7Å (slight degradation acceptable)

3. **Ensemble Diversity**: Pairwise RMSD
   - Current: 0.143Å
   - Target: 0.10-0.20Å (maintain)

### **Secondary Metrics**

4. **Per-residue-type recovery**: 
   - Structurally constrained (Gly, Pro): Should be higher
   - Sequence-neutral (Ala, Ser, Thr, Val): Expect lower

5. **Secondary structure bias**:
   - α-helix: Favor Ala, Leu, Glu
   - β-strand: Favor Val, Ile, Tyr
   - Loops: More flexible

6. **Hydrophobic core recovery**:
   - Buried residues: Should be hydrophobic
   - Surface residues: Should be polar/charged

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS

### **Implementation Mistakes**

1. **Forgetting `--use_seqemb` flag**
   - Without sequence embeddings, model has no sequence info!
   - Always use: `--use_seqemb` in training

2. **Not checking H5 files have embeddings**
   - Verify: `h5py.File(..., 'r')['seq_embed']` exists
   - If missing, run: `python models/esm_embeddings.py`

3. **Increasing w_seq too much (>150)**
   - Structure quality will degrade significantly
   - Find balance: w_seq = 80-100 works well

### **Interpretation Mistakes**

1. **Expecting 100% recovery**
   - State-of-art is 60-70% (ProteinMPNN)
   - 40-45% is good for a VAE (harder than discriminative models)
   - Many positions are truly sequence-neutral

2. **Comparing to wrong baselines**
   - Compare to other generative models (RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN)
   - Not to discriminative predictors (AlphaFold)

3. **Ignoring structural context**
   - High recovery with poor structure is meaningless
   - Must maintain <1Å RMSD for valid comparison
